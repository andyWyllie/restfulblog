This is my first 'full' coding project that I've pushed to GitHub.
=================

It is a simple blog site that is themed to be built for coffee enthusiasts. 
It is styled using semanticUI and some custom styling. It follows the conventional
RESTFUL routing using Express. Mongo is the database used for this project. 

Future commits will include 
  - updating the ReadMe file for a more in-depth explaination of what each chunk of code does.
  - adding user authentication to the project
  - adding in an animation on the show page
